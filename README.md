  ## Usage
  Once the inquirer has been installed. Run the command node index.js. Once that step has been completed you will be led through a series of prompts where you will type in the requested information. Don’t forget to site this repo in the “credits” section. Once all of the questions/prompts have been responded to a README.md file will be generated in the output folder. Images will need to be stored in an assets folder with appropriate <src> pathway manually typed into the README.md file. Once that step has been completed, copy the contents of the README.md file and paste in README.md file in the intended repo.
